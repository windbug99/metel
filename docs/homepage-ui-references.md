# Homepage UI Reference Sites for metel

Last updated: 2026-02-24

## Purpose
This document tracks homepage UI reference sites for future metel landing-page improvements.

metel positioning to preserve:
- Execution-first AI operations layer (not a chat UI wrapper)
- Reliability by default (verify, fallback, guardrails, logs)
- Cross-service orchestration (Calendar, Notion, Linear, Telegram)

## Selection Criteria
- Product narrative clearly explains "how it works"
- Security/reliability messaging is concrete, not vague
- Section hierarchy is scannable on desktop and mobile
- Visual style can be adapted without cloning brand identity

## Core Reference Sites
1. Linear: https://linear.app/homepage
- Use for: high-density but readable section rhythm, product-story flow
- Watch point: keep metel copy execution-focused, not project-management-focused

2. Temporal: https://temporal.io/
- Use for: reliability narrative (failure, retry, recovery) and system trust framing
- Watch point: avoid backend-heavy jargon on top sections

3. Retool: https://retool.com/
- Use for: balancing speed/value messages with enterprise security blocks
- Watch point: adapt to metel's actual implemented scope only

4. Vercel: https://vercel.com/
- Use for: hero clarity, modular feature cards, strong CTA hierarchy
- Watch point: do not over-minimalize if it hides operational depth

5. Snyk: https://snyk.io/
- Use for: risk-to-control storytelling and security credibility tone
- Watch point: keep claims tied to real guardrails in metel

6. Datadog: https://www.datadoghq.com/
- Use for: observability/logging language and trust-building structure
- Watch point: avoid overwhelming first-time visitors with too many blocks

7. droidclaw: https://droidclaw.ai/
- Use for: agent loop explanation pattern (perceive/reason/act-like framing)
- Watch point: preserve metel-specific workflow (Plan -> Execute -> Verify -> Replan)

8. n8n: https://n8n.io/
- Use for: workflow visualization and multi-step automation communication
- Watch point: distinguish metel from generic no-code automation branding

## Design Gallery (Exploration)
- Land-book: https://land-book.com/design/landing-page
- Lapa Ninja: https://www.lapa.ninja/
- Godly SaaS: https://godly.website/websites/saas

## How to Use During Redesign
1. Pick 2-3 sites max per design iteration.
2. Extract only one pattern each (hero, proof block, or flow section).
3. Rebuild with metel copy and IA, then run mobile/desktop visual QA.
4. Validate messaging against implemented capabilities in `README.md`.

## Rejection Rules
- Do not copy visual identity, copywriting, or exact layout composition.
- Do not adopt references that require claims metel cannot verify today.
- Do not prioritize novelty over clarity of execution reliability.
